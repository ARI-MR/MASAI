## <a name="overview"/> Overview
This document's goal is to show how to develop a new IOT Agent step by step. To do so, a simple invented HTTP protocol
will be used, so it can be tested with simple command line instructions as `curl` and `nc`. 

### Protocol
The invented protocol will be freely adapted from [Ultralight 2.0](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-IoTAgent-Cplusplus/blob/develop/doc/modules.md#ultra-light-agent). 
Whenever a device wants to send an update, it will send a request as the following:
```
curl -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/iot/d?i=ULSensor&k=abc&d=t|15,l|19.6' -i
```
Where:
* **i**: is the device ID.
* **k**: the API Key for the device's service.
* **d**: the data payload, consisting of key/value pairs separated by a pipe ('|'), with each pair separated by comma (',');

### Requirements

This tutorial expects a Node.js v0.10 (at least) installed and working on your machine. It also expects you to have
access to a Context Broker (without any security proxies).

## <a name="basic"/> Basic IOTA
In this first chapter, we will develop an IOT Agent with a fully working northbound API and no southbound
API. This may seem useless (and indeed it is) but will serve us well on showing the basic steps in the creation
of an IOTA.
 
First of all, we have to create the Node project. Create a folder to hold your project and type the following 
instruction:
```
npm init
```
This will create the `package.json` file for our project. Now, add the following lines to your project file:
```
  "dependencies": {
    "iotagent-node-lib": "*"
  },

```

And install the dependencies, executing, as usual:
```
npm install
```

The first step is to write a configuration file, that will be used to tune the behavior of our IOTA. The contents
can be copied from the `config-basic-example.js` file, in this same folder. Create a `config.js` file with it 
in the root folder of your project. Remember to change the Context Broker IP to your local Context Broker.

Now we can begin with the code of our IOTA. The very minimum code we need to start an IOTA is the following:
``` javascript
var iotAgentLib = require('iotagent-node-lib'),
    config = require('./config');

iotAgentLib.activate(config, function(error) {
  if (error) {
    console.log('There was an error activating the IOTA');
    process.exit(1);
  }
});
```

The IOTA is now ready to be used. Execute it with the following command:
```
node index.js
```

The northbound interface should now be fully functional, i.e.: management of device registrations and configurations.

## <a name="active"/> IOTA With Active attributes

In the previous section we created an IOTA that exposed just the Northbound interface, but that was pretty useless
(aside from its didactic use). In this section we are going to create a simple Southbound interface. It's important
to remark that the nature of the Southbound API itself has nothing to do with the creation process of an IoT Agent.
Each device protocol will use its own mechanisms and it is up to the IoTA developer to find any libraries that would 
help him in its development. In this example, we will use Express as such library. 

In order to add the Express dependency to your project, add the following line to the `dependencies` section of the
`package.json`:
```
    "express": "*",
```
The require section would end up like this (the standard `http` module is also needed):
``` javascript
var iotAgentLib = require('iotagent-node-lib'),
    http = require('http'),
    express = require('express'),
    config = require('./config');
```
And install the dependencies as usual with `npm install`. You will have to require both `express` and `http` in
your code as well.

Now, in order to accept connections in our code, we have to start express first. With this purpose in mind, we will
create a new function `initSouthbound()`, that will be called from the initialization code of our IOTA:
``` javascript
function initSouthbound(callback) {
    southboundServer = {
        server: null,
        app: express(),
        router: express.Router()
    };

    southboundServer.app.set('port', 8080);
    southboundServer.app.set('host', '0.0.0.0');

    southboundServer.router.get('/iot/d', manageULRequest);
    southboundServer.server = http.createServer(southboundServer.app);
    southboundServer.app.use('/', southboundServer.router);
    southboundServer.server.listen(southboundServer.app.get('port'), southboundServer.app.get('host'), callback);
}
```

This Express code sets up a HTTP server, listening in the 8080 port, that will handle incoming requests targeting 
path `/iot/d` using the middleware `manageULRequest()`. This middleware will contain all the Southbound logic, and 
the library methods we need in order to progress the information to the Context Broker. The code of this middleware
would be as follows:

``` javascript
function manageULRequest(req, res, next) {
    var values;

    iotAgentLib.getDevice(req.query.i, function(error, device) {
        if (error) {
            res.status(404).send({
                message: 'Couldn\'t find the device: ' + JSON.stringify(error)
            });
        } else {
            values = parseUl(req.query.d, device);
            iotAgentLib.update(device.name, device.type, '', values, device, function(error) {
                if (error) {
                    res.status(500).send({
                        message: 'Error updating the device'
                   });
                } else {
                    res.status(200).send({
                        message: 'Device successfully updated'
                    });
                }        
            });
        }
    });  
}
```

For this middleware we have made use of a function `parseUl()` that parses the data payload and transforms it 
in the data object expected by the update function (i.e.: an attribute array with NGSI syntax):
``` javascript
function parseUl(data, device) {
    function findType(name) {
        for (var i=0; i < device.active.length; i++) {
            if (device.active[i].name === name) {
                return device.active[i].type;
            }
        }

        return null;
    }

    function createAttribute(element) {
        var pair = element.split('|'),
            attribute = {
                name: pair[0],
                value: pair[1],
                type: findType(pair[0])
            };
        
        return attribute;
    }
    
    return data.split(",").map(createAttribute);
}
```

Here as an example of the output of the function return for the UL payload `t|15,l|19.6`:
``` javascript
[
    {
        "name": "t",
        "type": "celsius",
        "value": "15"
    },
    {
        "name": "l",
        "type": "meters",
        "value": "19.6"
    }
]
```

The last thing to do is to invoke the initialization function inside the IOTA startup function. The next excerpt
show the modifications in the `activate()` function:

``` javascript
iotAgentLib.activate(config, function(error) {
    if (error) {
        console.log('There was an error activating the IOTA');
        process.exit(1);
    } else {
        initSouthbound(function (error) {
            if (error) {
                console.log('Could not initialize South bound API due to the following error: %s', error);
            } else {
                console.log('Both APIs started successfully');
            }   
        }); 
    }   
});
```
Some logs were added in this piece of code to help debugging.

Once the IOTA is finished the last thing to do is to test it. To do so, launch the IOTA and provision a new device
(an example for provisioning can be found in the `examples/howtoProvisioning1.json` file). Once the device is 
provisioned, send a new measure by using the example command:
```
curl -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/iot/d?i=ULSensor&k=abc&d=t|15,l|19.6' -i
```
Now you should be able to see the measures in the Context Broker entity of the device.

## <a name="lazy"/> IOTA With Lazy attributes

### Previous considerations
The IoT Agents also give the possibility for the device to be asked about the value of one of its measures, instead of 
reporting it. In order to do so, the device must be capable of receiving messages of some kind. In this case, we are 
going to simulate an HTTP server with `nc` in order to see the values sent by the IOTA. We also have to decide a syntax
for the protocol request for asking the device about a measure. For clarity, we will use the same HTTP GET request we
used to report a measure, but indicating the attribute to ask instead of the data payload. Something like:
```
curl -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1:9999/iot/d?i=ULSensor&k=abc&q=t,l' -i
```
In a real implementation, the server will need to know the URL and port where the devices are listening, in order to
send the request to the appropriate device. For this example, we will assume that the device is listening in port 9999
in localhost. For more complex cases, the mechanism to bind devices to addresses would be IOTA-specific (e.g.: the 
OMA Lightweight M2M IOTA captures the address of the device in the device registration, and stores the device-specific
information in a MongoDB document).

Being lazy attributes of a read/write nature, another syntax has to be declared for updating. This syntax will mimic
the one used for updating the server:
```
curl -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1:9999/iot/d?i=ULSensor&k=abc&d=t|15,l|19.6' -i
```
Both types of calls to the device will be distinguished by the presence or absence of the `d` and `q` attributes.

A HTTP request library will be needed in order to make those calls. To this extent, `mikeal/request` library will be used.
In order to do so, add the following require statement to the initialiation code:
```
    request = require('request');
```
and add the `request` dependency to the `package.json` file: 
```
  "dependencies": [
  [...]
  
    "request": "*",
    
  ] 
```

The require section should now look like this:
``` javascript
var iotAgentLib = require('iotagent-node-lib'),
    http = require('http'),
    express = require('express'),
    request = require('request'),
    config = require('./config');
```
### Implementation

#### QueryContext implementation
The main step to complete in order to implement the Lazy attributes mechanism in the IOTA is to provide handlers for the context
provisioning requests. At this point, we should provide two handlers: the updateContext and the queryContext handlers.
To do so, we must first define the handlers themselves:
``` javascript
function queryContextHandler(id, type, attributes, callback) {
    var options = {
        url: 'http://127.0.0.1:9999/iot/d',
        method: 'GET',
        qs: {
            q: attributes.join()
        }
    };

    request(options, function (error, response, body) {
        if (error) {
            callback(error);
        } else {
            callback(null, createResponse(id, type, attributes, body));
        }
    });
}
```
The queryContext handler is called whenever a queryContext request arrives to the IOTA Northbound API. It is invoked once
for each entity requested, passing the entity ID and Type as the parameters, as well as a list of the attributes that are
requested. In our case, the handler uses this parameters to compose a request to the device. Once the results of the device
are returned, the values are returned to the caller, in the NGSI attribute format. 

In order to format the response from the device in a readable way, we created a `createResponse()` function that maps
the values to its correspondent attributes. This function assumes the type of all the attributes is "string" (this will
not be the case in a real scenario, where the IOTA should retrieve the associated device to guess the type of its 
attributes). Here is the code for the `createResponse()` function:
``` javascript
function createResponse(id, type, attributes, body) {
    var values = body.split(','),
        responses = [];

    for (var i = 0; i < attributes.length; i++) {
        responses.push({
                name: attributes[i],
                type: "string",
                value: values[i]
        });
    }

    return {
        id: id,
        type: type,
        attributes: responses
    };
}
```

#### UpdateContext implementation
``` javascript
function updateContextHandler(id, type, attributes, callback) {
    var options = {
        url: 'http://127.0.0.1:9999/iot/d',
        method: 'GET',
        qs: {
            d: createQueryFromAttributes(attributes)
        }
    };

    request(options, function (error, response, body) {
        if (error) {
            callback(error);
        } else {
            callback(null, {
                id: id,
                type: type,
                attributes: attributes
            });
        }
    });
}
```
The updateContext handler deals with the modification requests that arrive to the IOTA Northbound API. It is invoked once
for each entity requested (note that a single request can contain multiple entity updates), with the same parameters used
in the queryContext handler. The only difference is the value of the attributes array, now containing a list of attribute
objects, each containing name, type and value. The handler must also make use of the callback to return a list of updated
attributes.

For this handler we have used a helper function called `createQueryFromAttributes()`, that transforms the NGSI representation
of the attributes to the UL type expected by the device:
``` javascript
function createQueryFromAttributes(attributes) {
    var query = "";

    for (var i in attributes) {
        query += attributes[i].name + '|' + attributes[i].value;

        if (i != attributes.length -1) {
            query += ',';
        }
    }

    return query;
}
```

#### Handler registration
Once both handlers have been defined, they have to be registered in the IOTA, adding the following code to the setup
function:
``` javascript
    iotAgentLib.setDataUpdateHandler(updateContextHandler);
    iotAgentLib.setDataQueryHandler(queryContextHandler);
```

#### IOTA Testing
In order to test it, we need to create an HTTP server simulating the device. The quickest way to do that may be using 
netcat. In order to start it just run the following command from the command line (Linux and Mac only):
```
nc -l 9999
```
This will open a simple TCP server listening on port 9999, where the requests from the IOTA will be printed. In order for
the complete workflow to work (and to receive the response in the application side), the HTTP response has to be written
in the `nc` console (although for testing purposes this is not needed).  

Once the mock server has been started, proceed with the following steps to test your implementation:
1. Provision a device with two lazy attributes. You can see an example of this in the `examples/howtoProvisioning2.json` file.
2. Execute a queryContext or updateContext against one of the entity attributes (use a NGSI client of curl command).
3. Check the received request in the nc console is the expected one.
4. Answer the request with an appropriate HTTP response and check the result of the queryContext or updateContext request
is the expected one.

An example of HTTP response, for a query to the t and l attributes would be:
```
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 3

5,6
```
This same response can be used both for updates and queries for testing purposes (even though in the former the body won't 
be read).

## <a name="configuration"/> Configuration management

For some IoT Agents, it will be useful to know what devices or configurations were registered in the Agent, or to do some
actions whenever a new device is registered. All this configuration and provisioning actions can be performed using two
mechanisms: the provisioning handlers and the provisioning API.

### Provisioning handlers

The handlers provide a way for the IOTA to act whenever a new device, or configuration is provisioned. This can be used 
for registering the device in external services, for storing important information about the device, or to listen in new 
ports in the case of new configuration. For the simple example we are developing, we will just print the information we 
are receiving whenever a new device or configuration is provisioned.

We need to complete two steps to have a working set of provisioning handlers. First of all, defining the handlers themselves.
Here we can see the definition of the configuration handler:
``` javascript
function configurationHandler(configuration, callback) {
    console.log('\n\n* REGISTERING A NEW CONFIGURATION:\n%s\n\n', JSON.stringify(configuration, null, 4));
    callback(null, configuration);
}
```
As we can see, the handlers receive the device or configuration that is being provisioned, as well as a callback. The 
handler MUST call the callback once in order for the IOTA to work properly. If an error is passed as a parameter to the
callback, the provisioning will be aborted. If no error is passed, the provisioning process will continue. This mechanism
can be used to implement security mechanisms or to filter the provisioning of devices to the IOTA. 

Note also that the same `device` or `configuration` object is passed along to the callback. This lets the IOTA change some 
of the values provisioned by the user, to add or restrict information in the provisioning. To test this feature, let's 
use the provisioning handler to change the value of the type of the provisioning device to 'CertifiedType' (reflecting
some validation process performed on the provisioning):
``` javascript
function provisioningHandler(device, callback) {
    console.log('\n\n* REGISTERING A NEW DEVICE:\n%s\n\n', JSON.stringify(device, null, 4));
    device.type = 'CertifiedType';
    callback(null, device);
}
```

Once the handlers are defined, the new set of handlers has to be registered into the IOTAgent:
``` javascript
    iotAgentLib.setConfigurationHandler(configurationHandler);
    iotAgentLib.setProvisioningHandler(provisioningHandler);
```

Now we can test our implementation by sending provisioning requests to the Northbound API. If we provision a new device
into the platform, and then we ask for the list of provisioned devices, we shall see the type of the provisioned device
has changed to 'CertifiedType'.

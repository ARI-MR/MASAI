# 0.1.8

## Major features

* Broker will now require subscription requests to provide the complete URL for notifications.
  Previous behavior was to append the standard `/ngsi10/notifyContext` to the URL which is not done anymore.
  This allows applications to receive notifications with custom URL paths and parameters.

## Minor features

* Update to ngsi-api library 0.1.2

## Bug fixes

* print stacktrace on errors #56
* fix crash when parsing updateContext in JSON #57

# 0.1.7

## Minor features

* Update fiware-ngsi-api dependency to 0.1.1

*Warning:* Starting with this release, Cepheus Broker and CEP use JSON by default instead of XML for NGSI v1.
If a host initiates a NGSI exchange with Broker or CEP using XML, Cepheus components will keep communicating using XML.
XML support is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Fiware Cepheus.
